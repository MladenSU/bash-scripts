Repo where I will upload old and new `BASH/Python` scripts.

---

For now, there are only a few `BASH` scripts only.

### Table of content:
1. [get-dns-records](https://github.com/MladenSU/bash-scripts/tree/main/get-dns-records) - Accepts a domain name and returns the most common DNS records. 
2. [lets-encrypt-dns-check](https://github.com/MladenSU/bash-scripts/tree/main/lets-encrypt-dns-check) - Checks DNS records which can usually cause a conflict when installing Let's Encrypt SSL.
3. [verify-ftp-credentials](https://github.com/MladenSU/bash-scripts/tree/main/verify-ftp-credentials) - Checks whether FTP credentials are correct by using `cURL`.
4. [wordpress-plugin-theme-checker](https://github.com/MladenSU/bash-scripts/tree/main/wordpress-plugin-theme-checker) - Checks if all plugins, themes and WordPress core are up-to-date.
